## Machine Learning: Classification and Regression using Java

This GitHub repository contains two projects developed in Java that focuses on Machine Learning techniques of classification and regression.

### Classification:
Classification is a type of supervised machine learning task where the goal is to assign a label or category to an input data point based on its features. In the context of the Email Spam Classifier project, the task is to classify emails as either "spam" or "not spam" based on the content of the email. Classification algorithms learn from labeled training data, where each data point has a corresponding class label.

## Project 1: Email Spam Classifier

The Email Spam Classifier is a machine learning model that aims to classify emails as either spam or not spam. The classification is performed based on the detection of specific spam words present in the content of the email. The dataset used for training and testing this model consists of labeled emails that are manually annotated as spam or not-spam.

### Prerequisites
- Eclipse IDE (Integrated Development Environment)
- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- Java Machine Learning Library

### Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in Eclipse IDE.
3. Ensure that the necessary dependencies and libraries are properly configured.
4. Run the application and provide an email content to classify it as spam or not spam.


### Regression:
Regression, also a supervised learning task, involves predicting a continuous value output based on input features. In the context of the Linear Regression Model project, the goal is to predict the amount of tips a waiter would receive based on their gender.

One popular regression algorithm is Simple Linear Regression. It deals with predicting a continuous value y (dependent variable) based on a single input feature x (independent variable).

Simple Linear Regression Formula:
The simple linear regression model represents a linear relationship between the input feature x and the output y.

The equation for simple linear regression can be written as:

# y = β0 + β1 * x + ε

### where:

##### y is the predicted output (tip amount).
##### x is the input feature (gender of the waiter, typically encoded as 0 or 1).
##### β0 is the intercept (bias) term of the model.
##### β1 is the coefficient (weight) associated with the feature x.
##### ε represents the error term (residual) that accounts for the discrepancy between the predicted value and the actual value.
##### During the training process, the model estimates the values of β0 and β1 that best fit the data and minimize the error.

## Project 2: Linear Regression Model

The Linear Regression Model in this project is designed to establish the relationship between the gender of the waiters and the tips provided for waiters. The model aims to predict the tips based on the gender of the waiter using linear regression, a fundamental technique in predictive analysis.

### Prerequisites
- Eclipse IDE (Integrated Development Environment)
- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- Java Machine Learning Library 

### Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in Eclipse IDE.
3. Ensure that the necessary dependencies and libraries are properly configured.
4. Run the application and observe the predictions made by the linear regression model.


## Additional Notes

Both projects are intended to be educational and illustrative examples of machine learning techniques implemented in Java. They can serve as a starting point for more complex projects and help learners understand the basics of classification and regression algorithms.

If you have any questions or suggestions regarding the projects or their implementations, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

Happy coding!
